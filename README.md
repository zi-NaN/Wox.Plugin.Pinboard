# Wox.Plugin.Pinboard
[Wox](http://www.wox.one/) is an effective launcher for Windows and one of the alternatives to [Launchbar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) on Mac. It is more than a local file search engine as it supports custom plugins.

[Pinboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinboard_(website)) is a famous social bookmarking website. 

This plugin is developed to search and open the bookmarks quickly without opening Pinboard official site.
